<p><b>What is UnderLX?</b><p>

<p>UnderLX is an Android app that shows info about the Lisbon subway/metro and collects anonymous
data about its usage, for analysis so even more information can be presented later. The goal is
to help the subway user in its trips, making it easier and more comfortable to use this means of
transportation.</p>
<p>The information made available includes news and service interruptions as officially published,
statistics about those interruptions (disturbances), info about each station, network maps, etc.</p>
<p>The collected data will allow for calculating different statistics, like the time between
stations, the mean waiting time, the relative usage of each station, the amount of users depending
on the time of the day, etc. This data will be analysed and published as soon as the amount of
available data and technical resources allow.</p>
